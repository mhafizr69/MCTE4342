# Timer Ports
Learn how to control the Timers in controller ATMEGA 328 AKA PWM function

## Example 1
Produce a PWM signal with 50% duty cycle on Channel B of timer0 in Fast PWM mode with pre-scaler value of 64.

## Example 2
Produce a PWM signal with 50% duty cycle on Channel B of timer0 in Fast PWM mode with pre-scaler value of 1.

## Example 3
Produce a PWM signal with varying duty cycle of 0%, 25%, 50%, 75%, and 100% on Channel B of timer0 in Fast PWM mode with TOP value of 5 and pre-scaler value of 1.

## Example 4
Produce a PWM signal with 25% duty cycle on Channel A of timer1 in 10-bit Phase Correct PWM-mode with pre-scaler value of 8.
